## Overview

**Extract Data** is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to efficiently extract information from websites. It leverages the power of **Selenium** for dynamic content rendering and **Pandas** for structured data manipulation and storage. This repository provides a flexible framework for automating data extraction tasks, making it easier to gather valuable information from the web.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Content Handling:** Utilizes Selenium to interact with web pages that rely heavily on JavaScript, ensuring accurate data retrieval even for dynamically loaded content.
* **Structured Data Output:** Employs Pandas DataFrames to organize extracted data into a tabular format, facilitating easy analysis and further processing.
* **CSS Selector Based Extraction:** Uses CSS selectors (and optionally XPath) for precise targeting of HTML elements, making the scraping process robust and adaptable.
* **Modular Design:** The codebase is structured to promote reusability and easy modification for different scraping tasks.
* **Clear and Concise Code:** Written with readability and maintainability in mind.

## Stacks Applied

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* **Python (>= 3.9):** The primary programming language used for the entire project.
* **Selenium:** A powerful browser automation library used to interact with web pages, handle JavaScript rendering, and navigate complex websites.
* **Pandas:** A data manipulation and analysis library providing efficient data structures (like DataFrames) for storing and working with extracted data.
* **Beautiful Soup:** A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. While Selenium handles dynamic content, Beautiful Soup can be useful for parsing the static HTML source or for simpler scraping tasks within the same workflow.
* **Webdriver Manager:** A library that automatically manages browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) required by Selenium, simplifying the setup process.

## Quick Note About Web Scraping with Selenium

When dealing with modern web applications, much of the content is loaded dynamically using JavaScript. Traditional scraping libraries that only parse the static HTML source often fail to capture this dynamically generated data. **Selenium** overcomes this limitation by actually *driving* a web browser. This allows the JavaScript on the page to execute fully, rendering all the content before the scraping logic is applied.

This approach provides significant advantages for scraping complex websites but also comes with considerations:

* **Resource Usage:** Running a full browser instance can be more resource-intensive (CPU and memory) compared to static HTML parsing.
* **Execution Speed:** Browser automation can be slower than simply downloading and parsing HTML.
* **Setup:** Requires the correct browser driver to be installed and configured (though libraries like `webdriver-manager` helps automate this).
* **Detection:** Websites may employ anti-scraping measures that can detect and block Selenium-driven scraping.  It's crucial to use Selenium responsibly and ethically, respecting the website's terms of service. Techniques like using appropriate waiting times, rotating user agents, and handling CAPTCHAs may be necessary.

Despite these considerations, Selenium is often the most effective solution for extracting data from websites with dynamic content.  It allows for interaction with the page in a way that mimics a real user, making it possible to scrape data that would otherwise be inaccessible.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/goncalvpedro/extract-data.git](https://github.com/goncalvpedro/extract-data.git)
    cd extract-data
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Provide clear and concise instructions on how to use the scripts in your repository. Include examples if possible. For instance:

1.  **Configure the scraping parameters:**
    * Open the main script (e.g., `scraper.py`).
    * Modify the target URL(s) and CSS selectors according to the website you want to scrape.  This often involves inspecting the website's HTML structure using your browser's developer tools.
    * Adjust any other relevant settings (e.g., headless mode, waiting times) within the script.  Headless mode (`options.headless = True`) allows Selenium to run without opening a visible browser window.

2.  **Run the scraper:**

    ```bash
    python scraper.py
    ```

3.  **Access the extracted data:**

    * The scraped data will typically be saved to a CSV file (e.g., `output.csv`) in the project directory.  The filename and format can usually be configured within the script.
    * You can then use Pandas or other tools to analyze the generated data.  For example, you could load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for further manipulation:

        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.read_csv('output.csv')
        print(df.head())
        ```

## Best Practices

* **Respect `robots.txt`:** Before scraping any website, check its `robots.txt` file to understand the rules and restrictions set by the website owner.  You can usually find it at `http://www.example.com/robots.txt`.
* **Use appropriate waiting times:** Avoid overloading the website's server by adding delays between requests.  Selenium provides methods like `time.sleep()` or explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`) to handle this.
* **Handle exceptions:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations, such as network errors, changes in the website's structure, or anti-scraping measures.
* **Be mindful of data usage:** Ensure that you are using the scraped data ethically and legally, and that you comply with the website's terms of service and any relevant privacy regulations.
* **User-Agent Rotation**:  Websites can identify and block scrapers by looking at the User-Agent header.  Rotating through a list of User-Agent strings can help to avoid detection.
* **Headless Mode**: Running the browser in headless mode (without a GUI) can sometimes help to avoid detection, and it also reduces resource consumption.  However, some sites specifically target headless browsers.
* **CAPCHA Solving**:  Some websites use CAPTCHAs to prevent automated access.  Consider using a CAPTCHA solving service (with caution, and ensuring compliance with terms of service) if you encounter these frequently.
